# Techcamp-raspi
This repository is destinated only to myself. You can also use the code in there for your stuff, I don't mind. You can also hack the code however you want. There isn't any license on this. Also take in mind that a lot of code is not even tested, because I didn't have a chance to test it on the raspberry pi at the techcamp. Yeah, techcamp. It's a techcamp where you learn code, how to make a game and stuff. techcamp.org.uk is the website, if you want to check it out.

## PibrellaPorcupine
Just a few sequences of the Pibrella lights that I made. Also, FadingFast doesn't work pretty well. To execute and choose stuff, just run `pp_exec.py`. Make sure `pibrellaporcupine.py` is in there.

## PiCamera Menu TkS
Still to be tested, is just a series of functions and stuff to take photos and videos. Copy `pcmtks.py` and `pcmtks_exec.py` and run `pcmtks_exec.py` to start.

## Make it spin!
